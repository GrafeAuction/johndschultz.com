When making a decision, project yourself into the future: 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months. If you made a decision or choice, how would you feel or think about that decision at that time? Use that to help guide no-regret decision making.

I think I first heard this from Dad and have since heard it repeated in various forms throughout my life.

It's a simple framework, but it cuts through the noise fast. Most bad decisions feel obvious in hindsight because we didn't bother to simulate the hindsight before we acted. The regret was predictable. We just didn't slow down enough to predict it.

The power isn't in the time horizons themselves. It's in the forced pause. You're making your future self a stakeholder in today's decision. That future self has context your present self doesn't: the emotional dust has settled, the short-term pressure is gone, and the consequences have played out.

The framework also exposes decisions that feel uncomfortable now but won't generate regret later. Sometimes the right call is the one that stings today but sits well at six months. If future-you is at peace with it, present-you can handle the discomfort.
