Boredom is an insight creator. The magic you're looking for is in the work you're avoiding. The answers you're looking for are in the silence you're avoiding. You need fewer inputs, not more.

What am I avoiding? Silence, work, something else? Or do I need to seek rather than avoid, and does seeking actually enable me to avoid?

We treat boredom like a bug. Something to fix with another podcast, another scroll, another notification. But boredom might be your mind telling you it has enough raw material and needs to start building. The discomfort isn't the problem. The discomfort is the signal.

The silence isn't meditation or stillness. It's the absence of input. It's sitting with what you already know and forcing yourself to do something with it instead of seeking more.
