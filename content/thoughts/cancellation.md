If people made a movie about your life, what would be the key scenes?

Whenever you get cancelled. Dissed. Attacked.

If my life was a movie, this would be the best episode of a 10-part series.

You truly need the downs. They create the full story. Which makes me think...

If you're happy with you today, you've got to be happy with everything that's happened to this point. Because this is what makes me today, me.

Nobody's highlight reel includes the scenes that actually built them. But those are the scenes that matter. The cancellation, the public failure, the moment everyone turned on you. Those aren't interruptions to your story. They *are* the story. They're the scenes people would actually watch.

The comfortable seasons make terrible television. The valleys make great ones.
