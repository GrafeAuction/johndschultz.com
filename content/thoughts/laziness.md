Laziness is a deep indicator from within you that you're not doing something right with your own life.

This one cuts. Because it reframes laziness from a character flaw into a diagnostic tool.

If you can't get yourself to do the work, maybe the work is wrong. Not "wrong" as in unimportant, but wrong for you, wrong for this season, or wrong in a way you haven't been honest about yet.

There's also a sneakier version of laziness that doesn't look lazy at all. It looks diplomatic. Strategic. Wise. The decision to blend in rather than stand out. The choice to stay silent when you should speak. The comfortable act of collecting more knowledge instead of applying what you already have.

That's chameleon behavior dressed up as prudence. And it's just as much a signal of misalignment as the person who can't get off the couch.

*This idea shows up in [The Watchman Principle](/essays/the-watchman-principle/) (chameleon behavior) and [Understanding vs. Doing](/essays/understanding-vs-doing/) (industrious avoidance).*
