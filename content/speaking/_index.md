I speak at state and national auction industry conferences on AI adoption, technology strategy, leadership, and ethics. My sessions are built for practitioners, not theorists. Live demos, real workflows, and actionable takeaways you can use the next day.

## Topics

### AI in the Auction Industry
How auctioneers can practically incorporate AI tools into their daily workflow. Covers the "Big 4" AI tools, the Symphony Effect (chaining tools together), and the CLEAR prompting framework. Formats range from 1-hour strategic briefings to 3-hour deep dives with hands-on exercises.

### Ethics & AI
Navigating the ethical questions that come with AI adoption in a relationship-driven industry. Where's the line between efficiency and authenticity? What do your clients need to know?

### Leadership & Decision-Making
Lessons from running a national trade association and building an auction company. Focuses on practical frameworks for small, high-trust organizations.
