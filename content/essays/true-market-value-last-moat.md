Last August, I had a conversation with a colleague that stuck with me. We were talking about whether auctions actually find true market value. My argument was simple: how can it be true market value when maybe 5-10% of potential buyers ever see our marketing? We're calling it market value based on whoever happened to show up.

I [wrote about it at the time](/essays/true-market-value/). My answer was to build communities, find your own lake, pursue smarter marketing instead of more marketing. I believed it. I still do. But six months later, I think I was thinking too small.

## Something Is Shifting Underneath Us

Gary Vaynerchuk said it recently: "Brand is the only thing left in a world of technology at scale." He's talking about a future where execution becomes a commodity, where the tools to build a website, run ads, create content, and reach buyers are available to everyone. When everyone has the same tools, the only differentiator is who you are and what you're known for.

He's right. But he's only seeing half of it.

The CEO of Cloudflare, Matthew Prince, shared some numbers every business owner needs to hear. Ten years ago, for every two pages Google crawled from your website, they'd send you one visitor back. Fair trade. Today it takes six pages crawled for every one visitor. For ChatGPT? Two hundred fifty to one. For Claude? Six thousand to one.

Seventy-five percent of Google searches now end without the person ever leaving Google. They get their answer and move on. Your website never loads.

This isn't a trend. It's a structural shift. The browser, the search engine, the website as we know it. All of these were built for a world where humans looked at screens and clicked links. That world is ending.

What's replacing it? Software agents. Programs that act on behalf of people. Instead of you googling "used restaurant equipment near me" and clicking through three auction sites, your agent scans every auction platform, every marketplace, every liquidation listing simultaneously. It finds what matches your criteria, checks current bids, evaluates pickup terms, and either alerts you or bids for you.

In February 2026, Google released something called WebMCP. It's a protocol that lets websites expose their inventory and services directly to AI agents as structured data. No browser required. An agent doesn't need to "visit" your website and look at it the way a human would. It calls your inventory like a database query.

One SEO expert called it "the biggest shift in technical SEO since structured data." I'd go further. It's the biggest shift in how buyers find sellers since the internet itself.

## The Flywheel Flips

Here's where this gets personal for our industry.

The auction business model runs on a flywheel. Get more bidders, drive higher prices, sellers see the results, sellers bring you more consignments. The whole machine starts with buyer acquisition. That's why we spend on paid ads. That's why a database of hundreds of thousands of users matters. That's why marketplaces pitch "we've got the eyeballs."

Buyer reach is the moat. Or it was.

In the world I just described, agents turn buyer reach into a commodity overnight. If your inventory is structured and discoverable, agents find it. You don't need hundreds of thousands of registered users because agents represent millions of potential buyers simultaneously. You don't need a Facebook ad because agents don't scroll Facebook.

The scarce resource isn't buyer attention anymore. It's quality supply.

The flywheel flips: get the best sellers, structure your inventory so agents can find it, agents bring the buyers, higher prices follow, more sellers want you. The moat moves from the buyer side to the seller side, and the bridge between them is your data.

Sellers don't come to you because of your ad spend. They come because you have a reputation for handling complex liquidations well. Because you showed up, walked the floor, and made a plan when their business was closing. Because someone they trusted said "call Grafe." That's relationship-driven, and no agent is going to replace it.

But the buyer side? That's where agents take over. And they don't care about your website design, your logo, or your browsing experience. They care about one thing: can they read your data?

## True Market Value (for Real This Time)

Here's the part that got me excited.

Remember the question: what is true market value when only 5-10% of potential buyers see your marketing?

Agents solve the room-size problem.

Instead of 50 bidders who happened to see your Facebook ad, you could have thousands of agents scanning on behalf of qualified buyers across the country. For the first time, you're approaching something close to actual market saturation for any item you're selling.

"But won't agents kill the competitive bidding premium?" That was my first reaction too. Agents are rational. They don't get emotionally invested. They bid to their maximum and stop. No ego, no "just one more bid."

Maybe. But think about the math. You might lose some emotional premium per bidder. But if you go from 50 emotional humans to 5,000 rational agents, supply and demand still works. Fixed quantity of assets plus a dramatically larger demand pool equals higher prices. The sheer volume of competition could more than compensate for the loss of emotional escalation.

True market value might not require emotion. It might just require enough buyers in the room. And agents make the room infinitely bigger.

I asked in August 2025 whether used equipment ever reaches true market value. The answer might be: not yet. But not because the buyers aren't emotional enough. Because there aren't enough of them in the room.

## The Marketplace Trap, Round Two

I need to be honest about something here because I've lived through this before.

When online marketplaces came onto the scene, many of us used them. The pitch was compelling: "List with us, we have the buyers." And for a while, it worked. Then you realized you were a tenant on someone else's platform. Your buyers were their buyers. Your data lived in their system. Your brand looked identical to every other auctioneer using the same templates and the same ten categories.

Some of us saw it and built our own solutions. Others switched to technology providers that let them own their data while providing the bidding infrastructure. And still today, years later, there's hand-wringing about marketplaces at every industry meeting.

The agentic web is the same movie with different actors.

Today, if you're on a third-party marketplace, you don't control your data structure. You can't upgrade your category system. You can't make your inventory agent-readable on your own terms. You're waiting for your platform to innovate on your behalf. And they'll make that decision based on what's good for their business, not yours.

When an agent scans for "commercial kitchen equipment under $5,000 within 200 miles," it's going to find the inventory with the best structured data. If you're on a platform using 10 broad categories and three-word lot descriptions, you're invisible. Not because you don't have the right inventory. Because no machine can understand what you have.

You don't own your technology? You don't own your future. We learned this lesson once. Some of us are about to learn it again.

## What "Structured Data" Actually Means

I'll make this concrete because "structured data" can sound abstract.

At Grafe, we rebuilt our entire platform around a principle I've held for years: touch it once, make it findable by any system. A human catalogs a lot with photos, a lot number, and an abbreviated description. Our AI takes that input and generates a full listing with model numbers, specifications, dimensions, and condition details. One human action. One machine expansion. One structured record that our website, our marketing tools, our analytics, and eventually an agent can all read.

Our categorization is specific. Not "restaurant" but "commercial kitchen, bakery/pastry" or "commercial kitchen, pizza/Italian." Because an agent searching for pizza ovens shouldn't have to wade through 10,000 results tagged "restaurant."

Every lot has real data behind it. Not a blurry photo and "misc kitchen equip." Specifications a machine can parse and match to a buyer's criteria without guessing.

I didn't build this because I predicted WebMCP or the agentic web. I built it because structured data is just good practice. Computers should handle the mundane so humans can do the critical thinking. Data should be entered once and work everywhere. These are principles, not predictions. But it turns out that principles built for one era can carry you into the next one if they're sound.

## The Call

This isn't about AI hype. I've stood in front of rooms at MAA, WAA, and NAA conferences and talked about the AI shift. I've watched colleagues nod along and then go back to posting blurry photos with three-word descriptions on the same marketplace platform they've been on for a decade.

The window to get this right is open now. Not because the agentic web is here today (it's early), but because structuring your data is a years-long project, not a switch you flip. The companies that start now will be discoverable when agents go mainstream. The ones that wait will be invisible.

Here's what that looks like practically:

Your lot descriptions need to be machine-readable. Specifications, model numbers, condition details, dimensions. Not "misc kitchen equip." Real data.

Your categories need to be specific enough that a machine can tell the difference between a pizza oven and a walk-in cooler without reading a paragraph of text.

Your data should flow through your systems once. Catalog it right, and it should work for your website, your marketing, your analytics, and the agent that queries you in 2027.

And you need to own your stack, or at the very least, own your data. Because the companies that control their own infrastructure can adapt when the ground shifts. The ones who don't are hoping someone else makes the right call for them.

## The Room Gets Bigger

Six months ago, I asked whether used equipment ever reaches true market value. My answer was to build communities and find your own lake.

I was thinking too small.

The agentic web doesn't give you a better lake. It gives you the ocean. Every qualified buyer's agent, scanning every inventory source, finding every match. For the first time, we could approach real market saturation for a given asset.

But the ocean only works for you if your inventory is discoverable. If your data is structured. If your technology is yours.

Brand is the only thing left in a world of technology at scale. For auction companies, brand now means two things: the relationships that bring you quality supply, and the data quality that makes agents bring you buyers.

The companies that survive this transition won't be the ones that predicted it. They'll be the ones whose principles already pointed in the right direction.

True market value was always the goal. We might finally have the tools to find it.

The question is whether your data is ready when the room gets bigger.
