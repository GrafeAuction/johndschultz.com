*Why you're accountable for warning, not for results, and why silence isn't neutral*

---

Ezekiel was a priest with no temple to serve in.

He was thirty years old, living in exile by a canal in Babylon, watching his homeland crumble from a distance. The first wave of exiles had been taken in 597 BC. Jerusalem hadn't fallen yet, but it would. His purpose had been stripped away. And then God showed up, not in the holy place, but in enemy territory.

What followed was one of the strangest commissions in scripture. God told Ezekiel to speak to Israel, and then immediately told him they wouldn't listen.

> "Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels... And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that a prophet has been among them." (Ezekiel 2:3-5)

The measure of success wasn't "did they change?" It was "did you deliver the message?"

This reframes everything I thought I knew about responsibility.

## The Accountability Framework

I've spent most of my life assuming that if I communicate something and nothing changes, I've failed. The feedback loop seems obvious: speak, they respond, measure success by the response. If they don't change, speak differently. Speak louder. Speak softer. Find the right angle, the right timing, the right words.

But Ezekiel's commission inverts this entirely.

God makes him a watchman, someone stationed on a wall to warn of approaching danger. The watchman's job is to see clearly and sound the alarm. That's it. Whether the city responds is not his department.

> "If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you give him warning, and he does not turn from his wickedness... he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul." (Ezekiel 3:19)

You warned. They ignored you. They face the consequences. You're clear.

But here's the gut-punch:

> "If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning... that wicked person shall die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand." (Ezekiel 3:18)

Silence isn't neutral. It protects you to speak up. Staying quiet has consequences for *you* too.

This is not a comfortable framework for someone who'd rather avoid conflict.

## The Chameleon Problem

I wrote recently about laziness as a signal, "a deep indicator from within you that you're not doing something right with your own life." But there's a particular form of laziness that doesn't look lazy at all. It looks diplomatic. Strategic. Wise.

It's the decision to blend in rather than stand out.

The chameleon changes colors to match its environment. It's a survival mechanism. And in social contexts, it works the same way. You read the room, soften your edges, hold back the thing that might create friction. You tell yourself you're being prudent. Waiting for the right moment. Not wanting to damage the relationship.

But the right moment keeps not arriving. And the thing you needed to say calcifies into the thing you should have said, which eventually becomes the thing you'll never say.

This is filter-closing in relational form. You don't have to defend a position if you never take one. You don't have to face rejection if you never speak. The path of least resistance is always available, and it always feels reasonable in the moment.

The watchman framework calls this out. Silence isn't wisdom. It's not strategy. It's abdication, and it has consequences for you, not just for them.

## Hardened to Match the Wall

Here's what I expected God to say next: "Don't worry, Ezekiel. I'll soften their hearts. I'll prepare them to receive the message. Your job is to speak; my job is to open their ears."

That's not what he said.

> "But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart. Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead." (Ezekiel 3:7-9)

Israel is a brick wall. God's response isn't to tear down the wall for Ezekiel. It's to harden Ezekiel to match it.

The obstacle stays. You get toughened.

I've been thinking about how often I pray for obstacle removal. "God, change this situation. Remove this difficult person. Clear this path." It's a reasonable prayer. Sometimes God answers it.

But sometimes the provision isn't removal. It's capacity. Not a cleared path, but stronger legs. Not a softer opponent, but a harder forehead.

This changes how I think about difficulty. If I'm constantly asking for easier circumstances, I might be missing the point. The circumstance might be the curriculum. The resistance might be building something I need.

Ray Dalio talks about pain plus reflection equaling progress. He's onto the same principle from a secular angle: the obstacle isn't blocking growth, it's producing it. But Ezekiel adds something Dalio doesn't. The hardening isn't just useful, it's *provision*. God doesn't apologize for the difficulty. He equips Ezekiel to meet it.

## The Cost of Obedience

Ezekiel's faithfulness wasn't just verbal. It was physical.

God told him to lie on his left side for 390 days, then his right side for 40 days (430 days total, bound with cords so he couldn't turn over). In public. His neighbors watched. He ate rationed food, baked over a fire fueled by dung. He shaved his head and beard with a sword and divided the hair into thirds to symbolize Jerusalem's destruction.

This wasn't private devotion. It was public humiliation. The message required his body and his reputation, not just his words.

I keep coming back to this: **obedience had a cost that went beyond inconvenience.**

Most of the difficult things I avoid aren't physically demanding. They're socially costly. Speaking a hard truth might damage a relationship. Taking a clear position might invite criticism. Standing out might mean standing alone.

Ezekiel's example suggests that's part of the deal. Faithfulness sometimes costs comfort, dignity, or how others perceive you. The chameleon avoids those scenes. But those scenes are often the ones that matter most.

I wrote once about viewing your life as a movie, "if my life was a movie this would be the best episode of a 10 part series." The difficult chapters aren't bugs in the story. They're the plot. The scenes where you look foolish, where you're misunderstood, where you pay a cost for doing the right thing: those are the scenes that reveal character.

Ezekiel lying on his side for over a year, looking insane to his neighbors, faithfully embodying a message no one wanted to hear. That's not a detour from his calling. That *is* his calling.

## The Fatherhood Application

As a dad, I'm a watchman over my family.

This hit differently when I read it in our men's group. The watchman principle isn't abstract theology. It's a parenting framework. My daughter will make choices. She'll face consequences I can see coming and she can't. My job is to warn, clearly and repeatedly if necessary.

Her job is to decide what to do with the warning.

I can't control the outcome. I can't force obedience. I can't guarantee she'll listen. But I can guarantee I won't stay silent when I see danger.

The temptation is always to soften the message, to preserve the relationship, to avoid being the heavy. "She'll figure it out." "I don't want to push her away." "She needs to learn on her own."

Some of that is true. But some of it is chameleon behavior dressed up as wisdom. I'm avoiding the cost of speaking clearly because I don't want to deal with her reaction.

The watchman framework reframes this. Her reaction isn't my responsibility. My responsibility is to warn. If I warn and she ignores me, that's her choice. If I don't warn because I'm afraid of her reaction, her blood is on my hands.

That's a heavy phrase. It's meant to be.

## Strategic Silence

There's a pattern I've noticed in myself: I call silence "strategic" when it's actually avoidance.

"I'm waiting for the right moment." "I need to think about how to say this." "The relationship isn't strong enough yet to handle this conversation."

Sometimes those are legitimate. But increasingly I've started applying the no-regrets framework: project yourself forward, one month, three months, six months, a year. How will you feel about this decision at each point?

**One month from now:** Will I be glad I waited, or will I wish I'd spoken when I first saw the problem?

**Six months from now:** Will the "right moment" have arrived, or will I still be waiting?

**One year from now:** Will I look back on my silence as prudent, or as cowardice wearing a strategic mask?

The answers usually clarify pretty quickly. The "right moment" rarely arrives on its own. It arrives when you create it by speaking.

## The Freedom in the Framework

Here's what surprised me about the watchman principle: it's actually liberating.

If I'm responsible for outcomes, I carry an impossible weight. I have to find the perfect words, the perfect timing, the perfect approach. I have to anticipate every objection, manage every reaction, engineer every result. The burden is crushing because the variables are infinite.

But if I'm responsible for warning (just warning) the weight shifts. I say what I see. I say it clearly, with appropriate gravity. And then I'm done. What they do with it is their business.

This doesn't mean I speak carelessly. The watchman isn't shouting random words from the wall. He's watching carefully, identifying real threats, and communicating them clearly. But his job ends at communication. He doesn't have to climb down from the wall and personally defend every house.

I can speak hard truths without carrying the burden of whether those truths are received. I can warn my daughter without feeling like a failure if she doesn't listen. I can say the thing that needs to be said in a business context without managing everyone's emotional response to it.

The silence was heavier. Carrying the unsaid thing, wondering if I should say it, feeling the weight of potential consequences. That's the crushing burden. Speaking, even when it's hard, is the lighter load.

## The Question That Remains

Ezekiel sat in silence for seven days after his vision and commission, "overwhelmed among them" (3:15). Even with a direct call from God, he needed time to process before he spoke.

Maybe that's the balance. The watchman isn't impulsive. He watches carefully. He processes what he sees. He considers how to communicate it. But eventually, he speaks.

The question I keep asking myself: What am I sitting on? What truth have I seen that I haven't spoken? What warning am I strategically delaying that I already know needs to be delivered?

The answers you're looking for are in the silence you're avoiding. But sometimes the silence *is* the problem. Sometimes the answer isn't in contemplation. It's in the words you haven't said yet.

The watchman's job is to watch and warn. Watching without warning is just spectating. And spectators don't get to complain about the outcome.

*What warning are you sitting on? What "strategic silence" might actually be avoidance? Where do you need a harder forehead instead of an easier path?*
