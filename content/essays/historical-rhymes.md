*Why "we've seen this before" is the laziest thing you can say*

---

History doesn't repeat itself. It rhymes.

That's not a cute saying. It's the difference between someone who files a situation under "seen it" and moves on, versus someone who does the actual work of figuring out what's the same, what's different, and why it matters this time.

Most people stop at the first version. It feels smart. It's not.

## Where This Started

A colleague said something during early COVID that stuck with me: "History repeats itself." Simple observation, and at the time I nodded along. But as I sat with it, something felt off. The details never line up perfectly. The mechanics shift. The players change.

Then I started reading Ray Dalio and listening to James Holland, and the nuance clicked.

Holland's work on 1930s German propaganda is the one that keeps me up at night. The techniques from that era show up in today's information warfare. Both periods grew out of economic crisis (the Depression then, 2008 and COVID now). The playbook is the same: fear, othering, oversimplification. The delivery system changed. Radio became algorithmic feeds. But the human vulnerabilities being exploited? Identical.

Dalio's contribution is the financial angle. The 2008 crash rhymed with 1929. Both were excessive leverage unwinding. Both triggered by the same psychology: greed on the way up, panic on the way down. But the policy responses were different because (sometimes) people actually learned from the last time around.

The pattern exists. The details don't copy-paste.

## The Real Work

Here's what makes this useful instead of just interesting. When you spot a historical rhyme, you've got to ask five questions:

1. **What's the pattern?** Which historical parallel are you actually seeing?
2. **What's genuinely similar?** Same human psychology? Same structural conditions?
3. **What's fundamentally different?** New technology, new regulations, different global context?
4. **What created the original pattern?** Not just what happened, but why it happened.
5. **How have those causes evolved?** The trigger from 1929 doesn't fire the same way in 2008.

Skip any of those and you're just doing trivia. "This reminds me of the Depression" isn't analysis. It's a cocktail party observation.

The trap is thinking that spotting the rhyme tells you how the next verse goes. Markets crash in rhyming patterns, sure. But each crash has its own speed, its own triggers, its own recovery path. Companies fail in familiar ways (ignoring disruption, clinging to what worked, misreading the market), but each failure teaches you something new about what to watch for next time.

## Why We Get This Wrong

The lazy version of pattern recognition feels productive. You see a similarity, you categorize it, you feel like you understand what's happening. That little hit of "I've seen this movie before" is satisfying. And it's almost always incomplete.

The hard version requires you to hold two things at once: this situation rhymes with that one, AND this situation is different in ways that might matter more than the similarities.

That's uncomfortable. Your brain wants a clean match. Reality gives you a messy one.

Greed, fear, herd behavior, the cycle of innovation and disruption. These are the recurring melodies. They're baked into how people operate and they're not going anywhere. But technology, regulation, and how connected the world is at any given moment? Those change the key, the tempo, the instruments. Same song. Different arrangement. And the arrangement matters.

## What To Do With This

The people who actually benefit from historical thinking aren't the ones who memorize dates and draw parallels. They're the ones who understand *why* certain patterns keep showing up, and then pay close attention to where this version breaks from the last one.

They don't dismiss history. They don't worship it either. They use it as a starting point and then do the work of figuring out what's genuinely new.

"We've seen this before" is comfortable. It's also the exact moment you stop learning. The harder question, the one worth asking, is: "We've seen something *like* this before. What's different this time, and does the difference change everything?"

History rhymes. But we write the next verse.

*When's the last time you caught yourself saying "we've seen this before" and stopped there? What did you miss by not asking what was different?*
