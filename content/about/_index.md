I've been in the auction industry for nearly 30 years.

Today I serve as Partner and Chief Marketing & Technology Officer at [Grafe Auction Company](https://grafeauction.com), a nationally recognized leader conducting over 300 commercial and industrial online auctions annually across retail, hospitality, healthcare, and manufacturing.

I served as President of the [National Auction Association](https://auctioneers.org) from 2024 to 2025 and currently serve as Chairman of the Board. I hold the CAI (Certified Auctioneers Institute) and AMM (Auction Marketing Management) designations.

## What I Write About

Most of my writing circles a few recurring themes:

- **Leadership and decision-making** in small, high-trust organizations
- **Authenticity and vulnerability** as competitive advantages (not just soft skills)
- **Pattern recognition** across history, business, and everyday life
- **Technology and AI** applied practically to traditional industries
- **The gap between knowing and doing**, and what it takes to close it

The essays here started as handwritten thought cards, index-card-sized observations I jot down after conversations, books, or long drives. Some stay as thought cards. Others grow into longer pieces when the ideas connect in ways I didn't expect.

## Speaking

I speak regularly at state and national auction conferences on AI adoption, digital marketing, technology strategy, and leadership. Recent engagements include:

- **Schrader Real Estate & Auction** (2026) -- "Using AI Within the Auction Industry"
- **North Dakota Auctioneers Association Conference** (2026) -- "AI in the Auction Industry" + "Digital Marketing for Auctions"
- **NAA Digital Marketing Summit** (2026) -- "Data That Drives Decisions: Mastering Google Analytics & Search Console"
- **Michigan Auctioneers Association Conference** (2026) -- "AI Unveiled: From Old School to New School"
- **Wisconsin Auctioneers Association Conference** (2026) -- "AI Unveiled" + "Ethics & AI"
- **Minnesota State Auctioneers Association Conference** (2026) -- "The 1-Hour AI Advantage"
